A slightly modified starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

Changes that suit my needs:
- show gitignored files
- `gd` to go to definition
- `<s-j>` is disabled

This is a work in progress config.

Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
